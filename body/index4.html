           <h5> Part one </h5>
 <p class="stanza">

Two raindrops racing down the window.<br>
My mother brings me banana slices for my teethless self to gnaw on <br>
To smear all over my face and chubby little fingers. <br>

I see on tv the girls and boys walking home with their mommies and daddies hand in hand <br>
As the sky drizzles its april elixir <br>
They jump in puddles creating tsunami waves that their protectors are built for armoring <br>
Yellow raincoat, <br>
Colored rain boots. <br>

<br>

It could've been my emo phase why I found black so captivating. <br>
Or maybe the agony of middle school. <br>
I remember my daddy told me his favorite color is green because his lust for money. <br>
That tickled me, the colors ive always hated. <br>
Green, Orange, Yellow. <br>
<br>

	<h5> Part Two </h5>
<p class="stanza">
There is something about the contrast of light and dark that identifies as beautiful. <br>
The way yellow wraps around our universal melanin skin is breathtaking. <br>
Human forms bumblebees, black and yellow has never looked better. <br>
<br>

Each summer, my family would always taunt me with how dark I'd gotten from being outdoors. <br>
As if being a darker berry was a curse cast by social unacceptance. <br>
sun rays combined with cocoa butter kisses gives me a glow like no other, and I love the juice. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Sunflowers are some of the tallest flowers that i've ever seen grow. <br>
And they grow towards the sun, keeping their backs towards this pessimistic world. <br>
Coming out of high school id aspire to be more like a sunflower. <br>
        </p>

<h5> Part Three </h5>
<p class="stanza">
It is the sad truth that the moment after I opened my eyes, I open Snapchat to send my streaks. <br>
Not a good morning to my family, or breakfast my nourish my body. <br>
A newly filtered life I live, forgotten lively communication. <br>

<br>

If you have tumblr, you’d know that smoking cigs is more than a metaphor, it's a fad, aesthetics. <br>
It could be the coffee that stains teeth this situationally beautiful yellow color, <br>
Or maybe it's the collapse, because we all know mental health doesn't care about hygiene. <br>
Once my college professor advisor told me, “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” <br>
Like all of our lives are designed to be a tall nice glass of chilling lemonade. <br>
But I will take the lemon zest and make lemon scones to accompany a glass of tea. <br>
Lemon poppy seed muffins, be the lemons on baked cod, or that homemade facemask. <br>
My own speciality dish
